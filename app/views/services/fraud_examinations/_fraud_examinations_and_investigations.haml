  Fraud is characterized by concealment and deception. Consequently, most fraud goes undetected but results in higher costs of goods/services and losses of revenues. The 2018 Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse identified that the typical U.S. organization loses 5% of its annual revenues to fraudulent activities (https://www.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2018/). Fraud does not discriminate based on the size of the organization. Small businesses and multi-national conglomerates are all victimized.
