      From humble beginnings in 1991 the first show and car raffle raised $20,000 and this year the show and car raffle generated approximately $173,000.  Tyler Ford has donated a raffle car for the past sixteen years and this year’s 1962 Thunderbird Roadster Convertible, generated $73,300 from $10 raffle ticket sales.  This revenue helps support emergency shelter and crisis intervention services for victims of family violence and sexual assault.
