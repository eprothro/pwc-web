          Prothro, Wilhelmi & Co. was honored to volunteer at this year’s 2016 Auto and Cycle Show held by the East Texas Crisis Center in Tyler, Texas.  This annual auto show has the best collection of classic, antique and special cars, trucks and motorcycles in East Texas!

          From humble beginnings in 1991 the first show and car raffle raised $20,000.  This year, Tyler Ford donated this year’s raffle car, a 1965 Mustang Convertible, which generated $150,330 from $10 raffle ticket sales.  This revenue helps support emergency shelter and crisis intervention services for victims of family violence and sexual assault.
